# Copula

This is a group project written in R. A copula is a mathematical function that links the marginal distributions of a set of random variables to their joint distribution. In other words, it is a way to model the dependence structure between random variables separately from their individual marginal distributions. In context of this project, the copula will be used for modeling the dependence between the two assets.

This project is provided as an R Markdown (Rnw) file using LaTeX. It's important to note that you shouldn't simply use it in plain R. Follow these steps to make the most out of this project:

Install R and RStudio: If you haven't already, make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your system. You can download them from the official websites:

R
RStudio
Open the R Markdown File: Open the project.Rmd (or .Rnw) file provided in this repository using RStudio.

Knit the Document: In RStudio, click the "Knit" button to render the R Markdown document. This will execute the R code within the document and generate a formatted report with explanations, code outputs, and visualizations.

Follow the Interactive Guide: Navigate through the document interactively. You'll find explanations, code snippets, and visualizations that will guide you through the PCA analysis in R.
